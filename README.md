This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates a common off-by-one error. The program attempts to traverse an integer array using a `for` loop that has an incorrect loop condition.  The loop terminates one element past the valid indices of the array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `BugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.
